# Minimal blackbox-exporter config.
# We define a single HTTP probe module that considers 2xx/3xx as success.
# Prometheus will pass the real target URL (our app's /actuator/health) via relabeling.

modules:

    prober: http

      # By default blackbox treats 2xx and 3xx as success.
      # We keep defaults to stay simple.
